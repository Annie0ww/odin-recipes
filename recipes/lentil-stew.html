    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Lentil stew is an easy to make one pot dish that can make many servings. I make it to feed the fam for a few days. You can als make it one day in advance because every day the taste will get stronger. Perfect for those rainy days or lazy days, where you don't want to stand in the kitchen for long. All the ingredients could also work for a slow cooker, just let the cooker work for at least 5 hours to thoroughly cook the lentils </p>
